Project Description:
The Integrated AI Cardiac Monitoring System is an advanced hybrid healthcare platform designed to provide continuous,
personalized monitoring for post-operative cardiac patients. Traditional follow-up care often lacks real-time observation 
once patients leave the hospital, leaving them vulnerable to unexpected complications. This system addresses this gap by combining 
multi-parameter wearable sensors (tracking Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Body Temperature, SpO₂, and ECG) with a secure, cloud-based web platform. 
A central feature of the system is the Personalized AI Analytics Engine, which constructs a unique physiological model for each patient based on their complete medical history,
test results, and ongoing health data. Unlike conventional systems that rely on static thresholds, this engine continuously learns each patient’s baseline, enabling the detection of subtle,
patient-specific deviations that may signal emerging cardiac issues. Each patient is also equipped with an interactive Chatbot, facilitating symptom reporting, health queries, 
and guided instructions. The AI engine analyzes both the biometric data and patient-reported inputs to determine if intervention is necessary.
In the event of a critical change, the system automatically sends instant alerts to the physician, providing actionable insights for timely intervention.
The platform features a Patient Dashboard that displays real-time vital signs, AI-generated insights, and recommendations, and a Doctor Dashboard that consolidates patient data,
visualizes trends, and provides early warning alerts for all monitored patients. This integrated approach empowers physicians to make informed decisions, enhances patient engagement, 
and transforms post-operative cardiac care from reactive to proactive.
